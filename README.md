# TerminalTexting
Personal project I've been working on to experiment with Bluetooth communication between my phone and laptop. The terminal application is writen in python leveraging the curses library as well as the pyBluez project. The phone app is a android-studio project.

# Overview

# How to use it
The android studio project contains all the code for a deployable app. You can pull the project and open it in Android Studio. Alternitively, you can download the apk file and install the app that way.
The Linux application uses curses and thus needs to be fun from a terminal. It will also require sudo user privilagies due to the protections most OSs put on bluetooth periferals.
